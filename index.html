		Hello there friend.
		My name is Zoerab and I'd like to thank you for taking your time to look into the markup of this site.

		With this animated site I first tried to learn Sass but ended up doing it for fun.
		This is still an early stage of my learning so don't be surprised if you'll find error, typos and other bugs.
		Please feel free to use, reuse, fork, diddly-doodly-dazzle all the code and materials you like.
		If you have questions, suggestions or just want to chat feel free to contact me via following media:

		GitHub: https://github.com/zoerab
